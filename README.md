This is a third person shooter game with bots. Game mechanics allows both player and AI to destroy environment. Player has partial control of this process: in a short time window he can „freeze” falling debris. The goal is to defeat bots in limited time. Bots can move both on the ground and in the air. Player can move, jump, shoot and stop the process of destroy, as mentioned before. There are three possible material types: fully destroyable (creates fully colliding debris after destruction), indestructible, glass (destroyable but not colliding with player nor bots).
